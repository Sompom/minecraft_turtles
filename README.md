# Minecraft Turtles
A bunch of scripts and programs to make my minecraft world a little more automated. In many cases, there are obvious improvements to be made, but I have lost interest in Minecraft for the time being. All contributions would be welcome!

#Warehouse Turtle
A friend of mine described this as a filesystem for minecraft items.
This program is very complete and has some miles on it, so I'm fairly sure it's working with minimal bugs. The basic setup is described in the file itself. By modifying variables in the top of the file, you can configure the turtle to know the geometry of the warehouse. The code has a plethora of comments, so hopefully you can find your way.
There are some improvements to be made. For instance it would be helpful to use an actual database rather than text files, and it should be possible to use two or more turtles to speed up fetching items in a large warehouse. But, for now, this works perfectly well.

#Quarry Turtle
This program is more of a proof-of-concept stage. My goal is to be able to set down a chest and a turtle, then have the turtle dig for goodies whithout interaction from me. Currently it is mostly ideas resting on top of my library code.

#Libs folder
This folder contains some code by me, and some code sourced from various online forums. Where possible, I have marked where I got the library from.
Obviously, any code in these libraries that I did not write I claim no power over, so the overall license of this repository does not apply. Occasionally I have made small modificaions and bugfixes, but I leave those attributed to the original author.
